            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I’m an aspiring web developer, also a fiction writer with five published books so far. Right now I am working on my fifth one. I guess creative writing is what finally led me to coding, as both are almost the same, with one dealing in stories and using books as a medium, and the other writing programs and using the computer as it’s medium.</p>
            <p>I'm pretty much excited I have started on this new journey.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
             <p>One day in the near future I’d like to work as a freelancer helping private clients create an impressive online presence, and then later when I have mastered programmin languages, to try my hand at apps and software.</p>
